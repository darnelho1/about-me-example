  <h1>A Guessing Game (Assignment 1) for Code 201</h1>

  <p> The Java script on this page is prompting a user for their name and then storing it into a variable. It then uses string concatenation to alert the user using the stored name variable that it prompted the user for.</p>

  <h2> The Java script that runs the guessing game</h2>

  <p> The script that runs the guessing game does the following. It contains stored vairables with the correct answers for the 3 questions that the user is prompted with. It also contains a variable called <q>counter</q> than keeps tracks of the correct answers. The counter starts at 0.</p>

  <p> The script starts by prompting users for the answers to 3 questions it then takes those answers and stores them in 3 seperate variables. Those variables are then compared using the === operator to see if they match the stored variables with the correct answers.</p>

  <p> If a user gets the correct answer they are alerted with a message box that lets them know there answer was correct. It will also icrease the counter value by 1 if the answer is correct. If the answer is incorrect the user will be alerted with a box that lets them know there answer was incorrect and what the correct answer actually is.
